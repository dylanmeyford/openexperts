# MEDDPICC Sales Methodology

MEDDPICC is a deal qualification framework for complex B2B sales.

## Criteria

- **Metrics** — Quantifiable business outcomes the buyer expects.
- **Economic Buyer** — The person with budget authority and final sign-off.
- **Decision Criteria** — Technical and business requirements the solution must meet.
- **Decision Process** — Steps, stakeholders, and timeline for the buying decision.
- **Paper Process** — Legal, procurement, and contract approval workflow.
- **Identify Pain** — The core business problem driving the evaluation.
- **Champion** — An internal advocate who actively sells on your behalf.
- **Competition** — Alternative solutions or vendors the buyer is evaluating.

## Usage

Apply these criteria when evaluating deal health and determining next actions. Flag deals that are missing key qualifiers (especially Economic Buyer, Champion, or identified Pain) as at-risk.
