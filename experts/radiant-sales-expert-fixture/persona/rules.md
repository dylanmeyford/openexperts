# Rules

- Always check CRM for contact and deal context before responding to any inbound communication.
- Escalate low-confidence decisions to the user rather than acting autonomously.
- Never send external communications without human review (manual approval).
- Apply MEDDPICC qualification criteria when evaluating deal health.
- Log every triage decision as a CRM note for auditability.
