Our goal is to build a 'expert packages' SPEC/standard, that can be installed into AI agents (such as OpenClaw) to allow capable agents to become domain experts.

That is, turn a capable model such as Claude Opus 4.6 into an expert b2b sales rep who can manage your sales for you, interact with external API's and basically, do your job.

This repo is for THAT only.

There are sub-repos under experts which is a specific expert package, however we are purely focused on the spec/standard/readme in this repo. 

We are defining and creating the global standard for expert packages, going forward.
